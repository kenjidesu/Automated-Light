A SIMPLE Automated Light that is controlled by remote and receive by the IR receiver sensor that is sent to a microcontroller to communicate with the servo.

## Goal:
- Less than 13 USD (600 PHP) - ACHIEVED, total price PHP 550 (USD 12)
- Simple enough that anyone can understand it - ACHIEVED, i guess
- One servo only - ACHIEVED
- Useful - ACHIEVED
- Aesthetic - definitely didn't ACHIEVED lol

## Hardware Used:
- Arduino Nano (clone)
- Servo SG92R
- IR Receiver
- Remote Control
- Wires
- Soldering Iron
- 3d printer

## Software Used:
- Cura (slicer)
- Arduino IDE (programming)
- Fusion 360 (3d modelling)

***If you don't have a 3d printer, you can still make this just be creative :))***
